## 3. Project Description

The Fertilizer Recommendation System predicts the most suitable fertilizer for a given crop based on soil nutrient values and environmental conditions. The system takes inputs such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, moisture level, and crop type. Based on these inputs, a trained machine learning model recommends the ideal fertilizer for improving crop growth and yield.

Multiple machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier were tested during model evaluation. Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its higher accuracy and better performance. The model is integrated into a Flask-based web application where the user can enter input values through a web interface and get fertilizer recommendations as output.
